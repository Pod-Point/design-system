NOTE: This is a work in progress.
If there are any components that are required in the meantime, please create an issue in github [here](https://github.com/Pod-Point/dom-components/issues).

## TailwindCSS
To use Tailwind and the Pod Point config, first [install Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to your project and then copy the `tailwind.config.js` file into the root of your project and build the assets, we tend to use Gulp, but feel free to build as you wish.
